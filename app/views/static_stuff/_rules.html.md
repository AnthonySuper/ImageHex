## Images

- Do not upload images that you do not have the rights to upload.
Only upload images which you have either created yourself, or received permission to upload.
- ImageHex is an art website. 
Art comes in many forms, but images uploaded to ImageHex *must* have artistic merit. 
Defining this is hard, but as a rule of thumb, if it takes you less than 5 minutes to make, it probably doesn't belong on ImageHex (unless it's a speed sketch study or something similar&mdash;as we said, that is only a rule of thumb).
- Tag and flag your content properly, according to our [guidelines](/guidelines#content-ratings).
- Do not, under any circumstances, upload content that violates United States law.
Your account will be permanently banned, your image removed, and the relevant information provided to the authorities if you do so.
