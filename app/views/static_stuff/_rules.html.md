ImageHex tries to have a simple, easy-to-follow set of rules. We outline them here.

## Art Content
ImageHex tries to be very liberal in the content it allows.
We're here to showcase art, not to censor it.
That being said, we do have some guidelines.

### Disallowed Content
The following content is never allowed, for any reason.
Uploading content of this nature may get your IP address banned.

* Any content against the law in any state in the United States
  * Not many things fit into this category, but uploading content of this nature will result in the relevant information being provided to the authorities.
* Any sexually explicit content of a minor

### Content that must be flagged
Some content is allowed on ImageHex, but is required to be flagged when the image is uploaded.
This is to better accommodate viewers who don't wish to see certain kinds of content.

If content of this nature is not flagged, it may result in an immediate ban. Unless otherwise noted, images with any of these flags are not visible by default. You can change what kind of images you can see in your <a href="/settings">Settings</a>.

* **NSFW - Gore**: Images depicting serious injuries. This tag also applies to excessive blood and medical images.
* **NSFW - Language**: Images containing excessive profanity. If you cannot say it on public television, it probably needs this tag. Note that this tag is the only one of these filters which is visible by default.
* **NSFW - Nudity**: Images depicting exposed genitalia.
* **NSFW - Sexuality**: Images depicting sexuality, including explicit depictions of arousal or sexual intercourse. Note that these images will always also have the "NSFW - Nudity" flag on them as well.


## Tagging and Tags
In order to make images easier to find, ImageHex has some simple rules for tagging.

### When to Group
ImageHex uses *tag groups*, which are a much more accurate way of finding images than tags alone.
With tag groups, you can separate tags based on what they apply to in an image.
You should use a new tag group for each *subject* in an image.
Most of the time these subjects are going to correspond to a person (or an animal, or an alien&mdash;anything alive, really) within the image, but they don't have to.
ImageHex is a new website, and we're still figuring this out.
This section of the rules will be updated as we get more users.

### Adding Tags
Please tag your images accurately and as completely as you can.
However, please also don't go completely overboard.
Knowing somebody has a "red shirt" is good.
Knowing that she has "stained clothing" is also good.
"Mustard stained clothing", however, may be a bit extreme.

If a tag group applies to a character in a particular fictional universe, such as that of *Doctor Who* or *Dragonlance*, you should tag that universe as well.

### Creating Tags

If you feel the need to create a tag, go ahead and do it!
Try to give it an accurate description.
The ability to mark tags in as "potentially explicit" is coming soon&trade;.
When that does get implemented, be sure to mark the tag as such if its name or description may not be suitable for some users.

### Tag Naming

Try to use sensible names for tags, preferring to use the simplest term possible to name a tag.
If your tag is for a character in a certain franchise, add that franchise in (parenthesis) after its name.
For example, the tag should be "Walter White (Breaking Bad)" as opposed to simply "Walter White".

#### Tagging your Characters
If it is a character of your own creation, feel free to make a tag!
Simply add your user name in parenthesis after the tag name.
For example, if I invented a wizard named Kelvin and drew a picture of him, he should be tagged "Kelvin (anthony)".
