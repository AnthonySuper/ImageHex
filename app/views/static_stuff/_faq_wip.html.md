## Commissions
### Why do I have to enter my payment information before I'm able to send a commission?
You have to enter your payment info to protect artists from spammers and people interested in wasting their time. If anyone could make an account and immediately commission artwork, a popular artist may end up with 20 commissions in their inbox, only two of which are legitimate.


### What can artists and other users do to protect themselves from abusive users?
We take abusive, hostile behavior seriously. If you find that another user acts hostilely towards you, you're able to block and report that user. You're also able to close your private messages to allow messages only from those you follow or explicitly begin a conversation with. Commissions are open either to everyone or no one, but you will not receive commission requests from blocked users, and blocked users cannot tell they've been blocked.


### Someone claiming to be an ImageHex/Noided Media employee is asking for my password and/or credit card info, what should I do?
None of our employees will ever have any reason to request either your password or credit card information. Report the user to us if you see this behavior occurring, and _never_ share your password or payment information with others.


### An artist is asking me for my payment info, what should I do?
Artists should never ask for your payment info, this is handled by ImageHex. If you get a message from an artist you've commissioned asking you to send them your credit card or other payment info, do not send it.


### How is my artwork protected in a Commission?
To prevent unjust disputes on the part of the client, artwork is watermarked before being sent in a Commission thread. This makes it harder to simply download a work-in-progress piece and dispute the commission. While this is not a perfect solution, as clients can still screenshot the artwork to attempt to download it, they will not have the full resolution version, and will have a watermarked piece.

Once the artist finishes the piece, the client will be sent a final artwork to approve. At that point the client is able to accept the piece, and the artist is paid for their work.
