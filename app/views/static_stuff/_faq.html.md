### Why do I have to enter my payment information before I'm able to send a commission?
You have to enter your payment info to protect artists from spammers and people interested in wasting their time. If anyone could make an account and immediately commission artwork, a popular artist may end up with 20 commissions in their inbox, only two of which are legitimate.


### What can artists and other users do to protect themselves from abusive users?
We take abusive, hostile behavior seriously. If you find that another user acts hostilely towards you, you're able to block and report that user. You're also able to close your private messages to allow messages only from those you follow or explicitly begin a conversation with. Commissions are open either to everyone or no one, but you will not receive commission requests from blocked users, and blocked users cannot tell they've been blocked.


### Someone claiming to be an ImageHex/Noided Media employee is asking for my password and/or credit card info
None of our employees will ever have any reason to request either your password or credit card information. Report this user to us if you see this behavior occurring, and _never_ share your password or payment information with others.


### An artist is asking me for my payment info
Artists should never ask for your payment info, this is handled by ImageHex. If you get a message from an artist you've commissioned asking you to send them your credit card or other payment info, do not send it. Only input your payment info in this screen, this way Stripe is the only one to receive your private information, never ImageHex or any artist.


### Are my messages secure?
We encrypt all messages on our platform to prevent them from being accessed by bad actors, and normal message threads cannot ever be accessed by us.

Conversations between a client and artist in a commission, however, can be accessed by us when one or both parties dispute the commission.

If you discuss the commission, send payment info, or send the artwork itself outside of the relevant Commission thread in your Messages, we'll be unable to help in a dispute case.


### How is my artwork protected in a Commission?
To prevent unjust disputes on the part of the client, artwork is watermarked and separated into pieces before being sent in a Commission thread. What this does is make it harder to simply download a work-in-progress piece and dispute the commission. While this is not a perfect solution, as clients can still screenshot the artwork to attempt to download it, they will not have the full resolution version, and will have a watermarked piece.

Once the artist finishes the piece, the client will be sent a final artwork to approve. At that point is able to accept the piece, and the artist is paid for their work.


### How can I make sure my account is as secure as possible?
Anyone who has connected their payment information to ImageHex in order to either accept or pay for commissions should ensure that their password is secure: the longer your password is, the better. We also strongly recommend that you enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on your account. This guarantees that, even if someone else gets your password, they won't be able to access your account without physical access to your 2FA device.
