        ImageHex is a website for artists to expand their audience and take commissions.
      </p>
      <p>
        We make it easy to find artists you love.
        Our search makes it easy to find content you're interested in, no matter how oddly specific it is.
        Our tags are grouped together based on the subjects in the image, so a search for "Clown, swimming" is guaranteed to only get you pictures of swimming clowns.
        You can follow individual artists you like, so you can easily see all their images in one place.
        You can also follow curated collections created by other users, so discovering new art is easy.
      </p>

        For artists, ImageHex provides a place to share their art, and to gain new fans.
        We're also a great place to meet other artists to collaborate with.

        The team at ImageHex is hard at work creating the best commissions marketplace on the internet.
