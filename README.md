ImageHex
========

Some things to note:

1. You MUST install ImageMagick. Easily acomplished through the package manager
   of most distros and Homebrew.
2. We use a loose form of TDD. Have tests to ensure that your code works, but,
   if it makes sense to write code first and tests later, do that as well. Use
   discretion. If you're working here you're smart.
3. Once we push this up to Heroku, we're going to create a new branch called
   develop. Please, use that for develop work, and only let Anthony or Connor
   actually push up changes.
4. Set up the DB according to the config file.
