nv stands for "needlessly verbose". It's a test language that's basically
English, but written by a fanfiction author with a thesaurus and a desire to
sound really smart.

When writing nv translations for testing purposes, feel free to go all-out.
Maybe not entire paragraphs for everything, but for a lot of things, why not?
